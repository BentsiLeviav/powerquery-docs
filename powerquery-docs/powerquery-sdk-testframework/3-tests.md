# Power Query SDK Test Framework part 3 - Test Suite

This multi-part reference covers the setup and running of a standard suite of tests for Power Query connector developers. The reference is meant to be followed sequentiallyâ€”to ensure that your environment is set up for testing your extension connector.

In this lesson, you will:

> [!div class="checklist"]
>
> * Download the test suite
> * Learn about the different sections of the suite

You need the Test Suite to:

* Validate that the dataset is uploaded correctly, and
* Validate your connector

## Initial Setup

To ensure that you can run tests included in test framework, the below prerequisites must be completed:

* Clone the [DataConnectors](https://github.com/microsoft/DataConnectors) repo.
* Load the provided [test data](https://github.com/microsoft/DataConnectors/tree/master/testframework/data/) in the data source. This step was discussed in the previous section. If you not completed, refer to [Power Query SDK Test Framework part 2 - Test Data](./2-data.md) section and come back to this page once done.

### DataConnectors repo and the test suite

The [tests](https://github.com/microsoft/DataConnectors/tree/master/testframework/tests) are part of the [DataConnectors repo](https://github.com/microsoft/DataConnectors).

### Power Query SDK Test Framework - Test Suites

The Test Framework consists of a [test suite](https://github.com/microsoft/DataConnectors/tree/master/testframework/tests/TestSuites) to easily validate any extension connector.

The test suite consists of the following tests:

**Sanity**: The [sanity test set](https://github.com/microsoft/DataConnectors/tree/master/testframework/tests/TestSuites/Sanity) validates that the tests are able to connect to the data source and the test tables with correct schema exist in the datasource. There are also tests that validate the rowcount and data of NYCTaxiGreen and TaxiZoneLookup tables in the datasource.

**Standard**: The [standard set](https://github.com/microsoft/DataConnectors/tree/master/testframework/tests/TestSuites/Standard) contains various tests needed to validate the connector. There are tests to validate the datatypes, and functions/operators for Math, Date, Time, Text etc. There are also tests to validate joins between the two tables as well.

## Conclusion

This lesson gave you an overview of the test suite and where to download it from.

In the next lesson, you'll learn about the various file formats, and their purpose with the Test Framework.
