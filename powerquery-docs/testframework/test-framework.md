# Power Query SDK Test Framework Reference

This multi-part reference covers the setup and running of a standard suite of tests for Power Query connector developers. The reference is meant to be followed sequentiallyâ€”to ensure that your environment is set up for testing your extension connector.

This reference uses Power Query SDK Test Framework, a standardized test suite, and a modified version of the [NewYork City Taxi & Limousine Commission (TLC)](https://www.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page) green trip record data. The subsequent lessons walk through the steps to get your environment setup to validate your extension connector.

The following application is used throughout this reference:

* [Power Query SDK for Visual Studio](https://aka.ms/powerquerysdk)

We suggest that you review:

* [Installing the PowerQuery SDK](./../install-sdk.md#installing-the-power-query-sdk)
